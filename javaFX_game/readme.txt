Final project – KeyHero!
Guitar Hero-style game

The core classes for our Model include:
* A user score
* A user level
* A list of the upcoming keys
* A model to aggregate the above information

The game works and runs smoothly!

We were unable to get serialization implemented in time for a highscore/leaderboard.

We did not implement powerups.

We deviated from the original design a bit:
You don’t lose after missing 5 keys in a row. Instead when your 	 points go to 0 and the amount of points lost is a function based on your level.
We have single key presses instead of multi-key combos.

Note: Our restart button works but is slow. (we were able to reach level 18!).
